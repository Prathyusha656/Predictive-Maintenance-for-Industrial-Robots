Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Robots
Description
This project aims to leverage machine learning to predict when industrial robots are likely to fail. By analyzing data from simulated sensors (temperature, pressure, and humidity), the model can determine whether a robot should continue operating or stop, thereby enabling predictive maintenance. Although actual sensor data is not available, the project simulates real-time sensor readings to demonstrate how such a system might function in practice.

Project Overview
Predictive maintenance is essential for minimizing downtime and avoiding costly failures in industrial settings. In this project:

Simulated sensor data is generated every 3 seconds, including temperature, pressure, and humidity readings.
A machine learning model is trained on generated data to predict whether the robot should "Run" or "Stop" based on sensor values.
The system processes incoming sensor data in real time, allowing for timely decision-making.
Key Features
Real-time Data Processing: The system generates new sensor readings and makes predictions every 3 seconds.
Predictive Model: A Random Forest Classifier is trained to determine the operational status of the robot.
Simulated Sensor Data: Uses simulated data as a stand-in for actual sensor readings, making it flexible and easy to set up.

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Prathyusha656/Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Robots.git
cd predictive_maintenance
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required libraries using requirements.txt.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the Model
Run model_training.py to train the predictive model and save it as predictive_model.pkl.

bash
Copy code
python model_training.py
How It Works
Model Training: model_training.py generates random data to simulate sensor readings and labels (should_run). It then trains a RandomForestClassifier to classify whether the robot should "Run" or "Stop" and saves the trained model.

Real-Time Analysis: real_time_analysis.py loads the saved model and generates new sensor data every 3 seconds. The model then makes a prediction based on the latest sensor readings, outputting a decision to "Run" or "Stop."

Usage
Train the Model

Run model_training.py to generate synthetic data, train the model, and save it for later use.
bash
Copy code
python model_training.py
Start Real-Time Analysis

After training the model, run real_time_analysis.py to simulate real-time sensor readings and observe the model's predictions in real time.
bash
Copy code
python real_time_analysis.py
Every 3 seconds, a new set of sensor data will be generated, and the model will predict whether the robot should continue running or stop.
Future Work
Integrate actual sensor data to replace simulated values.
Expand the model to include additional features, such as vibration and torque data, to improve prediction accuracy.
Deploy the real-time analysis as a microservice for seamless integration with industrial systems.
